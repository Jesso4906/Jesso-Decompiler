# Jesso-Decompiler: C decompiler for Windows and Linux. 
Given intel machine code, the bytes will be disassembled and decompiled into a C program.
There is a GUI program for Windows made using wxWidgets (https://wxwidgets.org/), and a CLI version for Linux. Currently, the CLI is still being worked on to have the same features as the Windows GUI.

# This is a work in progress. 
I am focusing on delevoping the decompiler now, even though my disassembler is not fully comprehensive of the intel instruction set. 
However, at this point it disassemble most instructions that I have enountered so I decided to pause on implementing it further.
