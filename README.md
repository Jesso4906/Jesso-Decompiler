# Jesso-Decompiler: C decompiler for Windows. 
Given intel machine code, the bytes will be disassembled and decompiled into a C program.

# This is a work in progress. 
I am focusing on delevoping the decompiler now, even though my disassembler is not fully comprehensive of the intel instruction set. 
However, at this point it disassemble most instructions that I have enountered so I decided to pause on implementing it further.
